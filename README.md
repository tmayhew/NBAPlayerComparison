# NBAPlayerComparison

A web application that compares any two individual players throughout the NBA's history (since 1952, when most basic counting statistics were tracked) along with their career awards and regular season statistics. 

This app allows the user to input two former or current NBA players and then analyze:

* Career Accolades

* Career Regular Season Production Totals

* Basic Prime (or Peak) Regular Season Statistics

* Career Progression of any regular season statistic that was tracked for both players

* Individual Season Production and Efficiency

## Updates:

  At the beginning of any new season or the end of any drafting or signing period, run the NBAplayerLinks.R file. This will update the players list with any new players that have entered the NBA and registered minutes since the last update.
  
## Live Web App:

  Updates to the application will be posted to this github page and then deployed to https://tmayhew.shinyapps.io/nbaplayercomparison/; that is where the latest version of the web application can be accessed by anybody with an internet connection.
